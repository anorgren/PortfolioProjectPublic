# PortfolioProjectPublic
Simple portfolio web app used to host my resume and other related documents. Django was used to create the backend and
Bootstrap for the front end. This code will not build as it is missing a settings file that contained sensitive information. 
Other than the exclusion of that file, this code is the same as the production code.

## Technology
- Django 2.2
- Python 3.7
- Bootstrap
- Postgres
- gunicorn
- Digital Ocean for hosting

### Note
This was a self study to build my Django skills so the code still needs to be refactored and does not include comments. For a better example of finished code, please view my RecipeAppAPI or PizzaProjectApi.
