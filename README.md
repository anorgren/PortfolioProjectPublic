# PortfolioProjectPublic
Simple portfolio web app used to host my resume and other related documents. Django was used to create the backend and
Bootstrap for the front end. This code will not build as it is missing a settings file that contained sensitive information. 
Other than the exclusion of that file, this code is the same as the production code.

##Technology
Django 2.2
Python 3.7
Bootstrap
Postgres
gunicorn
Digital Ocean for hosting
